# Read Master - Development Progress

Started: 2026-01-17

## Iteration 1

[2026-01-17] infra-001: Created pnpm monorepo structure with workspace configuration
- Created pnpm-workspace.yaml defining apps/* and packages/* workspaces
- Updated root package.json with workspace scripts (dev, build, lint, typecheck, test)
- Created .npmrc with appropriate pnpm settings
- Created directory structure: apps/web, apps/api, packages/database, packages/shared, packages/ai, packages/config
- Created placeholder package.json files for all 6 workspace packages
- pnpm install runs successfully (3 dependencies installed: husky, prettier, typescript)
- All 7 workspace projects recognized by pnpm
- Feedback loops pass (typecheck, lint, test - placeholders)
- Files: pnpm-workspace.yaml, package.json, .npmrc, apps/*/package.json, packages/*/package.json

## Iteration 2

[2026-01-17] infra-002: Set up TypeScript configuration with strict mode for monorepo
- Created root tsconfig.json with strict mode and project references
- Created packages/config/tsconfig/ with shared TypeScript configurations:
  - base.json: Core strict TypeScript settings (strict: true, noUnusedLocals, noUncheckedIndexedAccess, etc.)
  - react.json: Extends base with React JSX support
  - node.json: Extends base for Node.js/serverless packages
  - library.json: Extends base for shared library packages
- Created tsconfig.json for all 6 workspace packages extending shared configs
- Configured path aliases (@/* -> ./src/*) for apps/web and apps/api
- Added typescript as devDependency to all packages
- Added @read-master/config workspace dependency to packages needing shared configs
- Created placeholder TypeScript source files (src/index.ts) for all packages
- Updated typecheck scripts to use real `tsc --noEmit` instead of placeholders
- pnpm typecheck passes with no errors across all 6 packages
- All feedback loops pass (typecheck, lint, test)
- Files: tsconfig.json, packages/config/tsconfig/*.json, */tsconfig.json, */src/index.ts

## Iteration 3

[2026-01-17] infra-003: Configure ESLint and Prettier with shared configs
- Installed ESLint dependencies in root package.json (@eslint/js, eslint, globals, typescript-eslint)
- Created packages/config/eslint/ with shared ESLint configurations:
  - base.js: Core TypeScript rules with strict settings (no-console, consistent-type-imports, no-unused-vars, etc.)
  - react.js: Extends base with React/JSX support and browser globals
  - node.js: Extends base with Node.js globals for backend packages
  - library.js: Extends base for shared packages (browser + node globals)
  - index.js: Re-exports all configurations
- Created packages/config/prettier/ with shared Prettier configuration:
  - index.js: Consistent formatting (semi, double quotes, 2-space indent, trailing commas, etc.)
- Updated packages/config/package.json with exports for eslint/* and prettier
- Updated root eslint.config.js to use shared config from @read-master/config
- Updated root prettier.config.js to use shared config from @read-master/config
- Created eslint.config.js for all workspace packages (web: react, api: node, database: node, shared: library, ai: library)
- Updated lint scripts in all packages from placeholders to `eslint .`
- Added `type: module` to root package.json to fix ESM module warning
- Added @read-master/config as workspace dependency to root package.json
- Ran pnpm format to fix formatting issues in markdown files
- All feedback loops pass: pnpm typecheck, pnpm lint, pnpm test
- Files: packages/config/eslint/*.js, packages/config/prettier/index.js, */eslint.config.js, */package.json
