TASK: gamification-leaderboards-001 - Build Leaderboards (global, friends, groups)

WHAT WAS DONE:
✅ **Fixed LeaderboardsPage.tsx**
- Fixed incorrect imports (was importing `useNewLeaderboard` types with `New` prefix)
- Fixed type references to use correct exported types from hook
- Removed unused icon imports (PagesIcon, AssessmentsIcon)
- Added proper type annotations for LeaderboardEntry in map functions
- Fixed Avatar component src prop type (cannot be undefined)

✅ **Fixed Leaderboards API Endpoint**
- Fixed import path for response utilities (responses.ts → response.ts)
- Fixed Prisma model name (UserFollow → Follow)
- Fixed user property access (avatar → avatarUrl)
- Fixed handler signature for withAuth middleware
- Replaced console.error with logger.error
- Added proper typing for UserStatsWithUser type

✅ **Tests**
- Created `apps/web/src/hooks/useNewLeaderboard.test.ts` (56 tests)
  - LeaderboardMetric type tests
  - LeaderboardPeriod type tests
  - LeaderboardType type tests
  - LeaderboardEntry structure tests
  - LeaderboardData structure tests
  - UseLeaderboardOptions tests
  - API URL construction tests
  - Score formatting helper tests
  - Rank change indicator tests
  - Tier colors mapping tests
  - Rank display tests

WHY IT MATTERS:
- **Gamification**: Leaderboards drive user engagement and competition
- **Social features**: Friends leaderboard encourages social connections
- **Retention**: Daily/weekly/monthly periods create return visits
- **Motivation**: Users see their progress relative to others

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
**Frontend (LeaderboardsPage.tsx):**
- Tabs for Global vs Friends leaderboards
- Toggle buttons for metric (Books, Time, Streak, XP)
- Toggle buttons for period (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, All-Time)
- Top 3 ranks shown with trophy icons and colors (gold, silver, bronze)
- Current user highlighted with different background
- User tier badges (FREE, PRO, SCHOLAR)
- Rank change indicators (up/down arrows)
- Loading skeletons for better UX
- Shows user's rank if not in top list

**Backend (API /api/leaderboards):**
- GET endpoint with query params (metric, period, type, limit)
- Zod validation for all query parameters
- Fetches from UserStats with user relation
- Supports global and friends filtering
- Calculates user rank if not in top list
- Returns leaderboard entries with metadata
- Uses proper auth middleware

DISCOVERIES:
No new high-value tasks discovered during this iteration.

FEEDBACK LOOPS:
✅ pnpm typecheck - Passed (all workspaces)
✅ pnpm lint - Passed (0 errors, warnings in unrelated files)

TASK: sentry-001 - Integrate Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring

WHAT WAS DONE:
✅ **Installed Sentry SDKs**
- @sentry/react@10.35.0 in apps/web
- @sentry/node@10.35.0 in apps/api
- @sentry/vite-plugin@4.7.0 for source map upload

✅ **Web App Integration** (`apps/web/`)
- Created comprehensive Sentry configuration (`src/lib/sentry.ts`)
- Initialized Sentry in `main.tsx` before React renders
- Added global ErrorBoundary with custom fallback UI
- Created SentryUserSync component for automatic user context tracking
- Integrated with Clerk authentication for user identification
- Configured React Router v7 tracing integration
- Enabled Session Replay (10% sample rate, 100% on errors)
- Privacy settings: mask all text, inputs, and media
- Performance monitoring: 10% trace sample rate in production

✅ **API Integration** (`apps/api/`)
- Created Sentry utility module (`src/utils/sentry.ts`)
- Created withSentry middleware wrapper (`src/middleware/sentry.ts`)
- Automatic error capture for all wrapped endpoints
- Performance transaction tracking
- Request context sanitization (redact auth headers, cookies)
- User context injection from auth middleware
- Automatic flush before serverless function termination

✅ **Source Maps Configuration**
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to use Sentry Vite plugin
- Automatic source map upload in production builds
- Delete maps after upload to prevent exposure
- Release tracking with VITE_APP_VERSION or git commit SHA

✅ **Environment Variables**
Required variables documented in `docs/SENTRY_SETUP.md`:
- `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` - Web app DSN
- `SENTRY_DSN` - API DSN
- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` - For source map upload (production only)
- `SENTRY_ORG` - Organization slug
- `SENTRY_PROJECT` - Project name (defaults to read-master-web)

✅ **Documentation**
Created comprehensive setup guide: `docs/SENTRY_SETUP.md`
- Complete setup instructions
- Environment variable configuration
- Usage examples for web and API
- Error filtering and privacy settings
- Performance monitoring configuration
- Troubleshooting guide
- Best practices and tips

✅ **Tests**
- `apps/web/src/lib/sentry.test.ts` (15 tests, 100% pass)
  - initSentry configuration
  - User context management
  - Breadcrumb tracking
  - Error and message capture
  - Context and tag setting
- `apps/api/src/utils/sentry.test.ts` (10 tests, 100% pass)
  - API initialization
  - User context
  - Error tracking
  - Flush functionality

WHY IT MATTERS:
- **Production readiness**: Essential infrastructure for monitoring live application
- **Error visibility**: Catch and diagnose errors before users report them
- **Performance insights**: Track slow API calls, frontend rendering issues
- **User context**: Associate errors with specific users for targeted fixes
- **Session replay**: See exact user actions leading to errors
- **Source maps**: Debug production errors with original source code
- **Release tracking**: Correlate errors with specific deployments

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
**Web App Features:**
- Error boundary catches React component errors
- Automatic user identification via Clerk integration
- Browser tracing for route navigation performance
- Session replay with privacy protection
- Ignores common noise (browser extensions, network errors)
- Custom tags: app, tier, feature, platform
- Breadcrumbs for user actions
- 10% transaction sampling in production

**API Features:**
- Wrap handlers with withSentry for automatic tracking
- Sanitize sensitive headers (auth, cookies, API keys)
- Track request duration and response status
- User context from auth middleware
- Breadcrumb trail for API calls
- 10% transaction sampling in production
- Flush events before function termination (2s timeout)

**Configuration Options:**
- Environment-specific settings (dev vs prod)
- Sample rates configurable per environment
- Ignore lists for known false positives
- Privacy controls for session replay
- Release tracking for version correlation
